# Features Overview

In this work, I used the SCSS technology, which in turn implemented mixins, extends, and the cycle principle (in the grid block). The BEM methodology was implemented, with the help of which a block approach to the layout of the site was implemented (use of separate blocks in separate .sass files ).In different sections, I used 2 technologies to display elements, i.e. flex box and grid containers. Particular attention was paid to the use of model grids where different number of column grids are displayed on different devices. Several small scripts were added, which in turn helped in working with the form and adding a class for a better implementation of the navigation block
